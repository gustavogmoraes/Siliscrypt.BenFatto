# Internal Notes - Keep Private

## Simple Division

**Gustavo**: Client meetings, complex issues, final delivery  
**Alvaro**: Most of the actual work, testing, documentation

## Rules

- Client only sees Gustavo
- All work gets presented as Gustavo's
- Alvaro escalates when stuck
- Keep this file private

## Quick Workflow

1. Tickets go in `tickets/todo/`
2. Alvaro moves to `doing/` and works on them
3. Document progress in `notes/`
4. Move to `done/` when complete
5. Gustavo handles client delivery

That's it. Keep it simple and adjust as needed.
